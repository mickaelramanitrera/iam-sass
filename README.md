![CI status](https://github.com/mickaelramanitrera/iam-sass/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)

This project is mostly a learning support for me to explore [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)'s new app router.

I will try to keep everything on one stack only using NextJS for backend and frontend.

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## The stack

This project uses :

- NextJS
- SWR
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn/ui
